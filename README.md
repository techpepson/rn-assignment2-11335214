The repository for the react native assignment 2

# About The Project

- This repo contains the source code for react native project that basically displays my name with some styling from StyleSheet.
- The project was created with expo-cli and bundled with the expo app on my phone.
- The app has a green background with centered body text that displays my name with the name boldened.

# Tasks and Features of the app

- In this app, I created the app with the expo cli with the command expo init "my-name-done".
- After that, I edited the minimal template provided by expo-cli to get my features based on the requirements of the app.
- I then applied a font size of 24 to the View component and then applied a background color of green.
- I also have some CSS-in-Javascript that applies some styling to the components to center them on the page.
- There is attached also a screenshot of my app.
